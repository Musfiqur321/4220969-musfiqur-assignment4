                  <p>Shakib Al Hasan is without a doubt the biggest name to have emerged from Bangladesh cricket circles. Being a genuine <mark>all-roundeer</mark> Shakib is a vital cog in Bangladesh's line-up. He has been a consistent performer for his country, over the years. Shakib first came into notice when he played cricket for several villages near his hometown of Magura. He spent time honing his skills at a government run sports facility and was picked for the Under-19 squad for the tri-series featuring England and Sri Lanka. He scored a 86-ball century and picked up three wickets in the final to help the team defeat Sri Lanka. This earned him selection for the series against Zimbabwe.</p>

He is short, very quick behind the stumps, always chuntering away and a brilliant batsman as well. He was initially picked as an understudy to Khaled Mashud for the tour of England in 2005, but as he impressed everyone with his competence with the bat in the tour games, he was made to play as a specialist batsman in the first Test at the age of 16. He thus became the youngest player to play at Lord's. An ankle injury forced him out of the side for a while before being recalled to the side for the tour of Zimbabwe in 2006</p>
